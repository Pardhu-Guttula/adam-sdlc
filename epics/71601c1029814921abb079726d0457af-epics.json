[{"id":"EPIC-1","title":"Secure Multi-Factor Authentication System","summary":"Develop a robust login mechanism with multi-factor authentication for secure customer access.","description":"Implement a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system that ensures customers can securely log in to the portal using multiple verification methods such as SMS, email, or authenticator apps. Include features like session timeouts, password recovery, and account lockout after repeated failed attempts. The authentication module must comply with banking security and regulatory standards, integrating seamlessly with the existing identity management infrastructure.","dependencies":[]},{"id":"EPIC-2","title":"Personalized Customer Dashboard","summary":"Build an interactive dashboard personalized to the user’s banking profile and eligibility.","description":"Design and develop a user dashboard that dynamically displays personalized content, such as available banking products, account balances, transaction summaries, and notifications. The dashboard should use customer data and eligibility criteria to highlight relevant products and provide a simple, intuitive user experience. It should serve as the central access point for all services while maintaining a clean and modern interface.","dependencies":["EPIC-1"]},{"id":"EPIC-3","title":"Responsive and Accessible User Interface","summary":"Ensure the portal provides a unified and accessible experience across all device types.","description":"Implement a responsive and adaptive user interface that functions seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Utilize modern UI frameworks to automatically adjust layouts and components for different screen sizes. The design should follow accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG 2.1) to support all users, including those with disabilities. Performance optimization and load balancing should ensure consistent responsiveness across platforms.","dependencies":[]},{"id":"EPIC-4","title":"Online Account Opening and Service Modification Workflows","summary":"Enable customers to open accounts and modify services online through guided workflows.","description":"Develop self-service workflows that allow customers to open new accounts, upgrade existing products, or modify current services directly through the portal. The workflows should include form validations, automated KYC/AML verification, and pre-populated data for convenience. Each workflow must minimize required clicks, provide clear step-by-step guidance, and ensure compliance with relevant banking and regulatory standards.","dependencies":["EPIC-1","EPIC-2"]},{"id":"EPIC-5","title":"Save and Resume Application Functionality","summary":"Allow customers to save incomplete workflows and resume them later on any device.","description":"Implement the functionality for users to save in-progress applications—such as account openings or service modifications—and resume them later from any device. Ensure smooth user continuity by persisting partial data in a secure, encrypted database. The system should prompt users to review previously saved drafts upon login, maintaining application history integrity and preventing data loss.","dependencies":["EPIC-4"]},{"id":"EPIC-6","title":"Document Upload and Verification Module","summary":"Provide customers the ability to upload necessary documents as part of the workflow process.","description":"Develop a secure file upload module enabling users to submit required identification or financial verification documents during application processes. Ensure documents are encrypted, virus-scanned, and validated for file type and size. Provide customers with clear instructions for required documents and enable administrative users to mark documents as verified or request re-submissions if necessary.","dependencies":["EPIC-4"]},{"id":"EPIC-7","title":"Real-Time Request Tracking and Notifications","summary":"Implement real-time tracking of all customer requests with proactive status notifications.","description":"Develop a request tracking system that allows customers to monitor the progress of their submitted requests—inclusive of account opening, product changes, and service modifications. Integrate event-driven notifications via email and SMS to inform customers of status changes, approvals, or additional required actions. Include a ‘Request History’ view to enhance transparency and ensure communication continuity.","dependencies":["EPIC-4"]},{"id":"EPIC-8","title":"Comprehensive Interaction History and Audit Trail","summary":"Maintain a detailed log of all customer interactions for transparency and audit purposes.","description":"Implement a robust audit trail system that records every user action within the portal, including logins, transactions, submissions, document uploads, and status checks. The audit history must be immutable, timestamped, and encrypted to ensure integrity. Provide customers with self-access to view their activity and allow authorized administrators to fetch audit reports for compliance and analysis.","dependencies":["EPIC-1","EPIC-2"]},{"id":"EPIC-9","title":"Core Banking System Integration","summary":"Integrate the portal with the existing core banking system for real-time data exchange.","description":"Develop integration mechanisms, such as APIs or message queues, to synchronize data between the self-service portal and the bank's core banking system. Ensure bidirectional communication for account details, balances, product eligibility, and transaction summaries. Implement error handling, data consistency checks, and load optimization strategies to maintain stable and efficient integration operations.","dependencies":["EPIC-4","EPIC-7"]},{"id":"EPIC-10","title":"Role-Based Access Control and Authorization","summary":"Implement role-based access control to manage data visibility and functionality per user role.","description":"Design and configure a role-based access control model that restricts feature visibility and permissions based on user roles such as retail customers, business clients, and administrative staff. The system should enforce strict role-based permissions across UI elements and API endpoints. Include an admin interface to manage roles and audit role changes for compliance monitoring.","dependencies":["EPIC-1"]},{"id":"EPIC-11","title":"Dedicated Portal Database and Performance Optimization","summary":"Create a separate portal database to ensure optimal performance and reliability.","description":"Establish a dedicated database architecture for the portal, independent from the core banking database, to handle requests, workflows, and user activity logs. Implement caching, indexing, and query optimizations to improve response times. Ensure the database maintains redundancy, encryption, and backup mechanisms. Routine performance monitoring should identify bottlenecks and support future scalability.","dependencies":["EPIC-9"]}]
