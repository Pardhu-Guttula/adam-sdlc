      "summary": "Set up a compliant, scalable, and secure Azure environment for hosting the banking platform.",
      "description": "This EPIC involves creating the foundational cloud environment on Azure to support the banking website. Tasks include establishing Resource Groups, Virtual Networks, Subnets, and Network Security Groups. Configure Application Gateways, Azure Key Vault for secret and encryption management, and implement Azure Policy for compliance enforcement. The design must prioritize high availability, security isolation between environments, and alignment with financial regulatory standards.",

      "description": "This EPIC focuses on developing user-facing features such as account creation, login, authentication, dashboard, transaction history, and fund transfers. The application must use strong secure coding practices, integrate identity management using Azure AD B2C, and enforce session controls. APIs and databases should be protected through Azure Private Link and encrypted communications, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.",

Key deliverables include deployment of Azure Firewall, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and DDoS Protection, along with endpoint hardening and RBAC implementation. Data encryption at rest and in transit must be enforced through Azure-managed keys. Security Center should be configured to monitor threats and compliance adherence to standards like PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and ISO 27001.",
