      "summary": "Provision and configure the Azure environment to support the secure banking platform.",
      "description": "This epic involves setting up a robust Azure infrastructure to host the banking website. Key tasks include creating Azure Resource Groups, configuring Virtual Networks (VNets), Subnets, Firewalls, and Load Balancers, and establishing Storage Accounts. It will also set up isolated environments for development, staging, and production with appropriate access controls. The objective is to lay down a secure, scalable, and resilient foundation for application deployment.",
