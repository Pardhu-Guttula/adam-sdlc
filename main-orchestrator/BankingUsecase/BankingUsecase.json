Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) has been added to protect the frontend, and geo-replication has been implemented for Azure SQL Database and Azure Blob Storage to ensure disaster recovery. Monitoring services like Azure Monitor are recommended for backend services, and cost optimization and performance efficiency strategies are suggested. The architecture now aligns more closely with the Azure Well-Architected Framework, achieving a higher quality rating.",
