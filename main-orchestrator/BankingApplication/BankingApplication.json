It includes support for username/password authentication combined with multi-factor verification methods such as OTP, biometrics, or email verification. The epic should also include the setup of role-based access controls to ensure customers, admins, and service agents only view and manage the appropriate sections of the system. Security best practices such as encrypted sessions, secure cookies, and session timeout policies must be enforced.",
