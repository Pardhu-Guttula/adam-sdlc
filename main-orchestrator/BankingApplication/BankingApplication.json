      "description": "This epic focuses on the implementation of a secure authentication system using multi-factor authentication (MFA) to verify user identities before granting access to the self-service banking portal. It also ensures proper role-based access control (RBAC), allowing users to access only products and services relevant to their profiles and authorization levels. Encryption of customer credentials, secure session management, and compliance with banking security standards will form the foundation of this module to protect sensitive financial information.",
