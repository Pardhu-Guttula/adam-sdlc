      "description": "This epic aims to provide a robust authentication and authorization framework for the self-service portal. It will implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods such as OTP, biometric verification, or app-based authentication to enhance security. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will also be enforced to ensure that users only access data and services permitted for their role or profile type. Security measures including encryption, tokenization, and session timeouts will be incorporated to maintain compliance with banking security standards and safeguard customer data integrity.",
