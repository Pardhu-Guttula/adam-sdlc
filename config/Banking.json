  "usecase": "Title:\n\nPayment Reconciliation Functionality\n\nObjective:\n\nTo design and implement a payment reconciliation module that automatically matches payment transactions received from external payment gateways and banks with internal accounting and order management records. The goal is to ensure financial accuracy, reduce manual effort, and enable timely identification and resolution of payment discrepancies.\n\nScope:\n\nThe functionality covers reconciliation of all customer payments processed through online and offline channels. It includes importing payment data from multiple sources, performing automated matching based on configurable rules, flagging exceptions, and generating reconciliation reports for review and audit.\n\nThe following systems are in scope:\n\nCore Accounting System\n\nOrder Management System\n\nPayment Gateway(s)\n\nBank Statement Integration\n\nOut of scope:\n\nManual journal entry posting\n\nCurrency conversion management\n\nFraud detection mechanisms\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n\nData Import and Integration\n\nThe system shall import transaction data from payment gateways and banks through secure APIs or file uploads (CSV/XML).\n\nThe system shall fetch internal payment records from the accounting and order systems.\n\nThe import process shall be scheduled or triggered manually by authorized users.\n\nAutomated Matching Logic\n\nThe system shall match external and internal transactions based on parameters such as Transaction ID, Amount, Date, and Payment Reference.\n\nThe system shall support configurable matching rules (e.g., exact match, fuzzy match, partial match).\n\nUnmatched transactions shall be flagged for manual review.\n\nException Handling and Manual Reconciliation\n\nUsers shall be able to view, filter, and update unmatched transactions.\n\nThe system shall allow users to manually link unmatched transactions to internal records.\n\nAll manual reconciliations shall be logged with user details and timestamp.\n\nReconciliation Reports\n\nThe system shall generate daily, weekly, and monthly reconciliation reports.\n\nReports shall include totals for matched, unmatched, and partially matched transactions.\n\nReports shall be exportable in PDF and Excel formats.\n\nNotifications and Alerts\n\nThe system shall notify users when reconciliation is complete or if exceptions exceed a defined threshold.\n\nAlerts shall be configurable by role and delivery channel (email, dashboard notification).\n\nSecurity and Access Control\n\nOnly authorized users shall access reconciliation data.\n\nThe system shall maintain an audit trail of all actions performed within the module.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nAll integrated systems expose APIs or data exports compliant with required formats.\n\nTransaction identifiers are unique across systems.\n\nReconciliation frequency and thresholds will be defined by the Finance team.\n\nPayment gateway and bank data are made available on time each day.\n\nThe solution will be deployed within the organization’s existing security framework.",
